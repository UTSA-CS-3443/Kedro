# How to run Kedro
- 1.) Download the necessary libraries from this google drive "insert google drive link here"
- 2.) Save the libraries in a folder you can access from eclipse
- 3.) Right click on the project after cloning and click on buildpath and then configure build path
- 4.) Then click on add external jars and browse to where the libraries are saved and add them
- 5.) Next will be to add the license which will be in the folder that the project is saved in.
Navigate here and find 2 files named jxmaps-1.3.1.jar and license.jar. File path from local git
 repo is \git\Kedro\jxmaps-1.3.1.jar and \git\Kedro\license.jar
- 6.) Add them to the list by selecting them and pressing open. The red ! should be gone off
 the project now
-7.) You can now run the program. Do not reorganize the file system or add files in manually
 or they won't be recognized
- Notes: we couldn't get the controller to use fxml documents in the view package so we had to
 keep them in the controller package
